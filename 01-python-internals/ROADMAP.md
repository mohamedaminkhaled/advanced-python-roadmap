# 🐍 Advanced Python Developer Roadmap (6+ Years Experience)

This repo is my personal **learning & project journey** for mastering advanced Python topics.  
Each stage contains **projects, checklists, and resources**.

---

## ✅ Stage 1 – Python Internals & Data Model
🎯 Goal: Master Python's data model, descriptors, metaclasses, and internals.

- [ ] Review Python Data Model (`__dunder__` methods).
- [ ] Implement descriptors (`__get__`, `__set__`, `__set_name__`).
- [ ] Explore metaclasses (`type`, `__new__`, `__init__`).
- [ ] Inspect CPython bytecode (`dis` module).
- [ ] Projects:
  - [ ] Custom ORM  
  - [ ] Config Manager  
  - [ ] Context Manager Framework  

📚 Resources:  
- *Fluent Python (2nd Edition)* – Luciano Ramalho  
- [Python Data Model – Official Docs](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html)  
- PyCon Talk: *The Art of Python Data Model*

## 🔄 Stage 2 – Advanced Concurrency & Parallelism
🎯 Goal: Build scalable async and parallel systems.

- [ ] Master `asyncio`, `async/await`.
- [ ] Use `concurrent.futures`, `multiprocessing`.
- [ ] Apply actor model & task queues (e.g., Celery, Dramatiq).
- [ ] Projects:
  - [ ] Async Web Scraper  
  - [ ] Task Queue with Retries

## 🧩 Stage 4 – Design Patterns & Large-Scale Architecture
🎯 Goal: Write production-grade maintainable Python systems.

- [ ] Implement classic & modern design patterns.
- [ ] Dependency injection, plugins, and modularity.
- [ ] Domain-driven design in Python.
- [ ] Projects:
  - [ ] Plugin System  
  - [ ] Event-Driven Architecture Demo  
  - [ ] Configurable CLI Framework

## 📊 Stage 5 – Data Engineering & ML Systems
🎯 Goal: Build robust data pipelines and ML-serving backends.

- [ ] Pandas internals, Polars, Arrow.
- [ ] Streaming pipelines (Kafka, Faust).
- [ ] ML model serving (FastAPI, BentoML).
- [ ] Projects:
  - [ ] Streaming ETL Pipeline  
  - [ ] Custom Feature Store  
  - [ ] ML Serving API

## 🔐 Stage 6 – Security, Testing & Tooling
🎯 Goal: Write safe, secure, and well-tested Python applications.

- [ ] Advanced `pytest` (fixtures, plugins).
- [ ] Fuzz testing, property-based testing.
- [ ] Security best practices (cryptography, secrets).
- [ ] Projects:
  - [ ] Custom Pytest Plugin  
  - [ ] Static Analyzer (AST-based)  
  - [ ] Secrets Vault Manager

## 🚀 Stage 7 – Distributed Systems & Cloud-Native Python
🎯 Goal: Build resilient distributed systems.

- [ ] Message brokers (Kafka, RabbitMQ, NATS).
- [ ] gRPC & Protobuf APIs.
- [ ] Orchestration with Kubernetes + Python.
- [ ] Projects:
  - [ ] gRPC Microservice  
  - [ ] Distributed Cache  
  - [ ] Kubernetes Operator in Python  

📚 Resources:  
- *Designing Data-Intensive Applications* – Martin Kleppmann  
- [gRPC Python docs](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/python/)  

---

## 📦 Stage 8 – Tooling & Open Source Contribution
🎯 Goal: Become a Python ecosystem contributor.

- [ ] Package publishing (PyPI, Poetry, Hatch).
- [ ] Build CLI tools with `typer` or `click`.
- [ ] Contribute to OSS projects (CPython, FastAPI, Pandas).
- [ ] Projects:
  - [ ] Publish PyPI Package  
  - [ ] Typer-based CLI Tool  
  - [ ] OSS Contribution PR

## 🏁 Final Stage – Mastery Project
🎯 Goal: Build a **capstone project** that integrates all previous stages.

Ideas:
- Distributed ML Serving Platform (FastAPI + Kafka + Cython optimizations).
- Serverless Event-Driven Data Pipeline.
- Python Developer Tool (like a linter, profiler, or framework).
