# 🐍 Advanced Python Roadmap

This repo documents my journey from **senior Python dev (6+ years)** → **expert in Python internals, system design, and distributed systems**.  
It’s structured as **stages**, each with projects, notes, and resources.

---

## 🚦 Roadmap Progress

✅ **Stage 1**: Python Internals & Data Model  
✅ **Stage 2**: Typing & Reliability  
⬜ **Stage 3**: Concurrency & Parallelism  
⬜ **Stage 4**: Architecture & System Design  
⬜ **Stage 5**: Data & Computation  
⬜ **Stage 6**: Tooling & Packaging  
⬜ **Stage 7**: Distributed Systems  
⬜ **Stage 8**: Security & DevOps  
⬜ **Stage 9**: Specialization (AI / Big Data / Finance)

## 📂 Repo Structure
Each stage has:
- **Projects** (hands-on implementations)
- **Notes** (design decisions, learnings)
- **References** (books, articles, tutorials)
